FIZZBUZZ:-
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

    answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
    answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
    answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
    answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
CONVERT THE TEMPERATURE
You are given a non-negative floating point number rounded to two decimal places celsius, that denotes the temperature in Celsius.

You should convert Celsius into Kelvin and Fahrenheit and return it as an array ans = [kelvin, fahrenheit].

Return the array ans. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Note that:

    Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15
    Fahrenheit = Celsius * 1.80 + 32.00

SMALLEST EVEN MULTIPLE
Given a positive integer n, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n. 

NUMBER OF GOOD PAIRS 
Given an array of integers nums, return the number of good pairs.

A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

FINAL VALUE OF VARIABLE AFTER PERFORMING OPERATIONS

There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

    ++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
    --X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.

Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

NUMBER OF ARITHMETIC TRIPLETS

You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff. A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:

    i < j < k,
    nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
    nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.

Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3. 



BACKSPACE STRING COMPARE


Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

BASEBALL GAME

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

    An integer x.
        Record a new score of x.
    '+'.
        Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
    'D'.
        Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
    'C'.
        Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.


MERGE STRINGS ALTERNATELY


You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.


MERGE SORTED ARRAY

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.


HOW MANY NUMBERS ARE SMALLER THAN THE CURRENT NUMBER

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

FIRST LETTER TO APPEAR TWICE


Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice.

Note:

    A letter a appears twice before another letter b if the second occurrence of a is before the second occurrence of b.
    s will contain at least one letter that appears twice.


RUNNING SUM OF 1D ARRAY

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.


LEFT AND RIGHT SUM DIFFERENCES

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a 0-indexed integer array answer where:

    answer.length == nums.length.
    answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|.

Where:

    leftSum[i] is the sum of elements to the left of the index i in the array nums. If there is no such element, leftSum[i] = 0.
    rightSum[i] is the sum of elements to the right of the index i in the array nums. If there is no such element, rightSum[i] = 0.

Return the array answer.
