FIZZBUZZ:-
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

    answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
    answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
    answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
    answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
CONVERT THE TEMPERATURE
You are given a non-negative floating point number rounded to two decimal places celsius, that denotes the temperature in Celsius.

You should convert Celsius into Kelvin and Fahrenheit and return it as an array ans = [kelvin, fahrenheit].

Return the array ans. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Note that:

    Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15
    Fahrenheit = Celsius * 1.80 + 32.00

SMALLEST EVEN MULTIPLE
Given a positive integer n, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n. 

NUMBER OF GOOD PAIRS 
Given an array of integers nums, return the number of good pairs.

A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

FINAL VALUE OF VARIABLE AFTER PERFORMING OPERATIONS

There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

    ++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
    --X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.

Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.
